# 📊 A/B Testing Study: Evaluating Targeted vs. Broad-Reach Marketing Campaigns

## 📝 Study Description

This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two marketing strategies using A/B testing:

- **Control Campaign** – A broad-reach strategy targeting a wide audience and promoting multiple products.
- **Test Campaign** – A targeted strategy focused on marketing a specific product to a niche audience.

The goal was to understand which campaign structure leads to better user engagement, product interaction, and sales performance.

## 📈 Objectives

- Analyze product views, cart additions, and sales from both campaigns.
- Measure conversion rates from cart to purchase.
- Determine the best use-case for each campaign type.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Control Campaign:**
  - Higher overall engagement and reach.
  - More products viewed and added to cart.
  - Greater total number of sales.

- **Test Campaign:**
  - Fewer overall views and sales.
  - Higher **conversion rate** from cart to purchase.
  - More effective at converting interested users into buyers.

## 📌 Conclusion

- The **Control Campaign** is ideal for **broad audience targeting** and promoting a variety of products.
- The **Test Campaign** is more effective for **targeted promotions**, especially when focusing on a single product and a defined audience.

Both strategies have unique advantages and can be used based on the specific goals of a marketing campaign—whether it's increasing overall visibility or boosting conversion for a particular product.

## ✅ Recommendation

Use a **hybrid approach** in future campaigns:

- Deploy **Control Campaigns** to raise brand awareness and drive traffic.
- Use **Test Campaigns** for remarketing, retargeting, or promoting high-margin or seasonal products to specific segments.
